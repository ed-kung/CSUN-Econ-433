# Course Description

### Prerequisites

ECON 309 and ECON 310 with a C or better. UDWPE score of 8 or higher.

### Course Overview

In the first book of Samuel in the Hebrew scriptures, the ancient Israelites demanded of the prophet Samuel, "Appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have." But Samuel warned them, "He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves. And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves." But the people refused to listen to Samuel. "No," they said, "There shall be a king over us, that we may be like the other nations, and that our king may go out and fight our battles." (1 Sam 8:4-20) This ancient record reflects the tension that has existed between governments and their people since the beginning of human civilization. People demand a government to lead and protect them, yet we chafe under the taxes and other impositions that government places over our lives.

In this class, you will study the economics of the public sector. The public sector is the sector of the economy where goods and services are provided by the government. You will learn why some goods and services are provided by the government instead of by private suppliers. You will then study the markets with the most public sector involvement in the U.S. and investigate specific policy issues therein. By the end of the course, you will be equipped to understand and analyze a wide range of policy issues.

In today's world, policy decisions are increasingly driven by data and evidence. You will therefore also learn basic and intermediate techniques for data analysis in R, a commonly used software for statistical analysis.

### Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- **Explain** what markets the U.S. government is involved in, and how and why they are involved them.

- **Construct** theoretical frameworks for analyzing the positive and normative implications of various public policy interventions.

- **Research** the relevant empirical evidence supporting or opposing different public policy positions.

- **Argue** convincingly for or against different public policy positions using evidence drawn from social scientific research.

- **Understand** the issue of endogeneity in empirical work, and **explain** the strategies researchers use to address endogeneity.

- **Evaluate** the quality of empirical research.

- **Conduct** basic data exploration and analysis operations in R.


# Course Materials

### Required Textbook

<img src="assets/images/textbook.jpg" width="90">

The required textbook is *Public Finance* by Harvey Rosen and Ted Gayer (ISBN: 9780078021688). While you do not have to purchase the textbook, you should ensure that you have access to a copy because required readings will be assigned from the textbook.

### RStudio Cloud

<img src="assets/images/Rstudio.png" width="100">

RStudio is a development environment for R. We will be using a cloud-based version of it: https://posit.cloud.

You'll need to sign up for a free account to use it.

### Assigned Readings

Occasionally, I will assign readings from newspaper or academic journal articles. These will be posted to Canvas. You are responsible for reading these and you may be quizzed on them.

# Exam Policies and Information

There will be two in-class programming midterms. In these midterms, you will be provided with data and asked to perform one or more data analysis tasks on it. You will submit your code for grading.

Each task will be graded on execution, and the overall code will be graded on professionalism. Grading rubric:

| Points | Execution (4 points for each task)               | Professionalism (3 points for whole assignment) |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | No attempt to perform task                       | No attempt at best practices                    |
| 1      | Major errors, including code that does not run                  | Two or more best practices not followed         |
| 2      | Code runs, but major logical error leading to task not being done correctly                  | One of the best practices not followed          |
| 3      | Code runs, but minor logical error leading to task not being done correctly | All best practices are followed                 |
| 4      | The task is done correctly      |                                                 |

# Additional Course Policies and Resources

### Communications Policy

My preferred form of communication is in-person after class or at office hours, or by email. If you email me and I do not respond within 24 hours, do not hesitate to re-send the email. Sometimes emails get lost in the shuffle.

### Late and Missing Assignment Policy

Requests for late submissions or extensions, beyond what is allowed in the syllabus, must be submitted by email with accompanying documentation. Only unanticipated family or medical emergencies, or other extraordinary events, will be considered valid reasons. Events that could reasonably have been anticipated, such as heavy academic workload or busy work schedule, will not be accepted as valid reasons.

### Academic Integrity

By taking this course, you certify that all work is your own. Plagiarism is not allowed, and you are not allowed to have someone else do any course work in your place. If it is discovered that you have violated academic integrity on any assignment, you will receive a grade of zero for that assignment. Repeated violations of academic integrity may result in a failing grade for the entire course.

Special consideration may be given to students with caregiving responsibilities at home (children, disabled family members, etc.). Please get in touch with me if you need an extension and have caregiving responsibilities.

### Minimum Attempt Policy

You must at least attempt to answer every question on an assignment. If you skip a question without attempting an answer, you may receive a grade of zero for the entire assignment.

Why do I have a minimum attempt policy? Because demonstrating effort is important, especially in the workplace. Not even attempting a task is worse than attempting it and getting it wrong. I want to encourage all students to at least make an attempt at all tasks. As Kobe Bryant said, "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."

### Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability or need special accommodations, please register with the Disability Resources and Educational Services ([DRES](https://www.csun.edu/dres)) office or the National Center of Deafness ([NCOD](https://www.csun.edu/ncod)). If you would like to discuss your need for accommodations with me, please contact me to set up an appointment.

### Emergency Food and Shelter

If you are experiencing an emergency need for food or shelter, do not hesitate to utilize the resources available to you on campus. More information: https://www.csun.edu/heart.

### University Counseling Services

If you have need for counseling regarding any personal or academic issues, do not hesitate to reach out to the University's counseling services. More information: https://www.csun.edu/counseling/students.

### Tutoring Services

Tutoring services may be available for this course. Please contact the Economics Department for information: https://www.csun.edu/economics.

### Diversity Statement

It is my intent that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives will be well served by this course, that students' learning needs will be addressed both in and out of the classroom, and that the diversity students bring to the class will be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities in a way that is respectful to students from all backgrounds, and that students from all backgrounds have an equal opportunity to succeed in the course. If you have any concerns, feel free to reach out to me.

### All Other Policies

In general, the course follows all relevant CSUN policies and procedures as documented here: https://catalog.csun.edu/policies/alphabetical. Please pay special attention to the rules on **attendance** and **academic dishonesty**.
