- Time and location TBD

# Course Description

### Prerequisites

ECON 309 and ECON 310 with a C or better. UDWPE score of 8 or higher.

### Course Overview

In the first book of Samuel in the Hebrew scriptures, the ancient Israelites demanded of the prophet Samuel, "Appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have." But Samuel warned them, "He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves. And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves." But the people refused to listen to Samuel. "No," they said, "There shall be a king over us, that we may be like the other nations, and that our king may go out and fight our battles." (1 Sam 8:4-20) This ancient record reflects the tension that has existed between governments and their people since the beginning of human civilization. People demand a government to lead and protect them, yet we chafe under the taxes and other impositions that government places over our lives.

In this class, you will study the economics of the public sector. The public sector is the sector of the economy where goods and services are provided by the government. You will learn why some goods and services are provided by the government instead of by private suppliers. You will then study the markets with the most public sector involvement in the U.S. and investigate specific policy issues therein. By the end of the course, you will be equipped to understand and analyze a wide range of policy issues.

In today's world, policy decisions are increasingly driven by data and evidence. You will therefore also learn basic and intermediate techniques for data analysis in R, a commonly used software for statistical analysis.

### Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- **Explain** what markets the U.S. government is involved in, and how and why they are involved them.

- **Construct** theoretical frameworks for analyzing the positive and normative implications of various public policy interventions.

- **Research** the relevant empirical evidence supporting or opposing different public policy positions.

- **Argue** convincingly for or against different public policy positions using evidence drawn from social scientific research.

- **Understand** the issue of endogeneity in empirical work, and **explain** the strategies researchers use to address endogeneity.

- **Evaluate** the quality of empirical research.

- **Conduct** basic data exploration and analysis operations in R.

### Assigned Readings

Occassionally, I will assign readings from newspaper or academic journal articles. These will be posted to Canvas. You are responsible for reading these and you may be quizzed on them.

# Group Project Details

### Overview

For this group project, you will choose a topic relevant to public economics and produce three deliverables:

1. **A review article for an academic research paper.** Choose an academic journal article relevant to the topic you chose. Write a review of the paper. The review should summarize the research question, data, methodology, and results. It should also offer an opinion as to the validity and implications of the results.

2. **A research proposal.** Write a proposal for further research on the topic you chose. The proposal should springboard off the paper that you reviewed. Explain how your proposal will extend or address the results in the paper. Outline a credible research strategy.

3. **A presentation to the class.** You will present both your review article and your research proposal to the class. The goal of the presentation is to inform the class about current research in the topic that you choose.

### In-Class Group Sessions

The group projects will start towards the end of the semester. The lab sessions in the last four weeks of the semester will be used for group project work. Some sort of checkpoint or deliverable will be required at each session.

### Graded Components

- Attendance (3 pts for each in-class session)
- Review Article First Draft (5 pts)
- Review Article Final Draft (20 pts)
- Research Proposal First Draft (5 pts)
- Research Proposal Final Draft (20 pts)
- Presentation Draft Slides (5 pts)
- Final Presentation (15 pts)

### Review Article

You will choose an academic journal article and write a review article. The paper that you choose must be cleared with me first.

The review article should be around 3 pages of writing, with additional pages allowed for the inclusion of tables and figures. The review article should answer the following questions:

- What is the question being studied by the paper?
- Why is this question interesting or important?
- How does the paper attempt to answer the question? What data is used and what is the methodology?
- What are some of the key endogeneity issues that the paper's authors seek to address with its research design?
- What are the paper's results? 
- Do you find the methodology convincing? What are some of the strenghts and weaknesses of the paper?
- Discuss the paper's broader implications for public policy and economics

The review article will be holistically graded on the following factors:

- Clarity. Was I able to understand your article? Were parts of it confusing o rhard to understand?
- Accuracy. Did you describe the research question, data, methodology, and results accurately? Were your critiques of the paper accurate?


### Research Proposal

You will write a research proposal which is on the same topic as the academic paper you chose to review. 

The research proposal should be no longer than 2 pages of writing, and should only exceed 2 pages for the purposes of listing data requirements. The proposal should answer the following questions:

- What is the research question you wish to study?
- Why is it important or interesting?
- How does it relate to previous research?
- What is your hypothesis?
- What data do you need to conduct the research? Identify the unit of observation.
- What methodology will you use to answer the question?
- What are the key endogeneity issues that you are concerned about? How will your research strategy address them?

The proposal will be graded holistically on the following factors:

- Clarity. Was I able to understand the proposal? Were parts of it confusing or hard to understand?
- Relevance. Is your research question interesting or important? Is it relevant to the topic you're interested in studying?
- Potential for success. If this were a real project, what is the chance that this proposal would result in a successful research project? Did you correctly identify the sources of endogeneity? Does your methodology properly address it? Is the data you requested the appropriate kind of data?

The proposal should contain the following sections:

- Project Description
- Background and Motivation
- Hypothesis
- Proposed Methodology
- Required Dataset

### Presentation

You will present both your review article and your research proposal. The goal of the presentation is to inform the class about current research on the topic that you chose.

The presentation should be around 20 minutes long with 5 minutes at the end reserved for questions.

The presentation will be graded on the following factors:

- Clarity. Was I able to understand the presentation? Were any parts of it confusing or hard to understand? Did the presenters speak clearly?
- Professionalism. Were the slides professionally made? Did the presenters use professional language and were they appropriately dressed?
- Participation. Did the entire group participate?
- Knowledge. Did the group appear to have a firm grasp of the topic? Were they able to answer questions convincingly?
