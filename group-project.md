# CSUN Econ 433: Group Data Project

# Overview

Your group will:

- Propose a research question using ACS/Census data from IPUMS (or another dataset if you so choose).
- Propose a methodology for answering the question.
- Acquire the necessary data.
- Conduct the analysis.
- Present the results to the class.

# Deliverables

1. A research proposal
2. A research report

# Research Proposal

The research proposal should not exceed 2 pages (12pt font, single spaced), except to include tables and figures. The research proposal should answer the following questions:

The proposal should contain the following sections:

- **Project Description**
    - What is the research question you wish to study?
- **Background and Motivation**
    - Why is the question important or interesting?
- **Hypothesis**
    - What do you expect to find?
- **Proposed Data and Methodology**
    - What data do you need to conduct the analysis?
        - What is the outcome variable?
        - What are the main covariates of interest?
        - What are the nuissance variables?
        - What is the unit of analysis?
    - How will you use the data to answer your question?
- **References**

The proposal will be graded holistically on the following factors:

- **Clarity**. Was I able to understand your proposal? Were parts of it confusing or hard to understand?
- **Relevance**. Was I persuaded that your research question interesting and important?
- **Professionalism**. Was the proposal formatted attractively? Was the language professional? 
- **Potential for success**. Is the proposed methodology likely to succeed in answering the research question?


# Research Report

The research report should not exceed 4 pages, except to include tables and figures. The research report should include the following sections:

- **Project Description**
  - What was the research question that you studied?
- **Background and Motivation**
  - Why is the question important or interesting?
- **Hypothesis**
  - What did you expect to find?
- **Data and Methodology**
    - What data did you use to conduct the analysis?
        - What was the outcome variable?
        - What were the main covariates of interest?
        - What were the nuissance variables?
        - What was the unit of analysis?
    - How did you use the data to answer your question? What charts did you make and what regressions did you run?
- **Results and Discussion**
  - Report your results here. Include tables and figures. Discuss your results as you present them.
  - Do the results support your hypothesis?
  - What are the implications of your results?
  - Are there alternative explanations for your results? What are the limitations of your methodology? How would you address those limitations in future work?
- **Conclusion**
  - A brief, one paragraph concluding remarks.
- **References**

The research report will be graded holistically on the following factors:

- **Clarity**. Was I able to understand the report? Were parts of it confusing or hard to understand?
- **Accuracy**. Did the report accurately describe the results? Were the interpretations of the results accurate?
- **Professionalism**. Was the report formatted attractively? Was the language professional? Were the appropriate tables and figures included?
- **Contribution**. Did the results meaningfully contribute to answering the research question? (Even if the hypothesis is rejected, that is still a meaningful contribution.)
