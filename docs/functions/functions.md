# Functions

Here I've attempted to provide simple documentation for every function you'll use in this class.

No guarantee that every function you need will be documented here. It is a work in progress!

There's also a lot more to learn about how each of these functions can be used in R. My purpose here is only to document the ways these functions will be used *in this class*.
