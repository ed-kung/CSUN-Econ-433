# Why R?

- Working with data usually involves a complex series of steps. Writing those steps in a series of instructions, as computer code, makes the process reproducible and easy to share with others.

- R is open source software, meaning it is free for anyone to use. It also has a large and active community of developers.

- It is an in-demand skill. A tech company manager looking to hire econ masters students once told me that they were only looking for students who knew R or Python. Knowing Excel was not sufficient.

### What about Python?

- In my opinion, Python is actually easier to use and more powerful than R. 

- However, it is still easier to run regressions in R than in Python, especially regressions with a lot of dummy variables.  Since we'll be doing that a lot in this class, R is a better choice for now.

- But a skilled data analyst should really know all three of R, Python, and SQL.

### What does statistical analysis have to do with Public Economics?

- The study of economics, including public economics, is becoming more and more data driven. Economists, if they are equipped with the right data skills, are well positioned to make impactful contributions to their organizations by combining solid economic theory with compelling statistical evidence.
