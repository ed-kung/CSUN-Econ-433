## Regression Analysis

In this lab you will learn how to conduct regression analysis of linear models in R.

### Background

A model relates an outcome variable to one or more variables called covariates. The outcome variable is sometimes called the "dependent variable" and the covariates are sometimes called the "independent variables". 

A *linear* model specifies the outcome variable as a linear equation in the covariates. An example of a linear model is:

$$Y = \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \epsilon$$
