## Linear Models

In this lab you will learn how to estimate linear models in R and to interpret the results. 

## Background

A **model** relates an **outcome variable** to one or more variable called **covariates**. 

**Outcome**: The variable that you are seeking to explain or predict. Also sometimes called the **dependent variable**.

**Covariate**: The variables that influence the outcome variable. Also sometimes called **independent variables**, **regressors**, or **features**.

A **linear model** specifies the outcome variable as a linear function of the covariates. An example of a linear model is:

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \epsilon$$

In this model, the outcome variable is $Y$ and the covariates are $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$. The terms $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\beta_3$ are known as **coefficients**.
