# ECON 433 - Lab Session 2
## Introduction to R

In this lab you will be introduced to R, a programming language designed specifically for statistical analysis. 

**Why R?**

- Working with data can involve a complex series of steps. Writing a set of instructions as code makes the process more reproducible and easier to share with others. 

- R is open source software, meaning it is free for anyone to use. It also has a large and active community of developers.

- Data science is an in-demand skill. R is one of the most commonly used tools among data scientists (along with Python). A tech company manager once told me that they're only looking for interns who can work in R or Python. Excel was not sufficient. 

## Lab Work 

In this lab, you will download a data file that I have downloaded in advance from IPUMS. You will load the data file into R and conduct some basic data exploration tasks.
