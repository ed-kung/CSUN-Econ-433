# ECON 433 - Lab Session 5
## Data Wrangling II - Grouping and Summarizing, Reshaping

In this lab session you will learn how to collapse data and compute summary statistics by groups. You will also learn how to reshape data--from long form to wide form and back.

### Setup

For this lesson you will need the `dplyr` package. Make sure it is installed with `install.packages("dplyr")` and loaded with `library(dplyr)`. You will also need the files:
- `IPUMS_ACS2014_CA_1.csv`
- `IPUMS_ACS2014_CA_2.csv`
- `IPUMS_ACS2019_CA_1.csv`
- `IPUMS_ACS2019_CA_2.csv`
- `COUNTY_CODES.csv`
- `DEGFIELD_CODES.csv`
Make sure these files are in your working directory for beginning.
