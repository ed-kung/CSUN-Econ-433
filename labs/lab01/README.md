## Introduction to Public Datasets with IPUMS

In this lab, you will be introduced to a public data repository maintained by the University of Minnesota known as IPUMS. IPUMS allows users to download microdata from the U.S. Decennial Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). The Census and the ACS are the two main surveys researchers use to track U.S. socioeconomic data over time. The data is useful for both marketing and policy research.

**Microdata** - *Microdata* refers to data about individual survey units, in this case people and households. The opposite of microdata is *aggregated data*. An example of microdata is a table showing the income level and state of residence for each individual who took the survey. An example of aggregated data is a table showing the average income for each state. Researchers generally consider microdata to be more valuable than aggregated data because aggregated data can be calculated from microdata, but not the other way around.

An example of microdata:

| Person    | State | Income     |
| --------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Alice     |    CA | $80,000    |
| Bob       |    NY | $90,000    |
| Charlie   |    CA | $50,000    |
| Dan       |    WY | $100,000   |
| ...       |   ... | ...        |

An example of aggregated data:

| State | Average Income |
| ----- | -------------- |
| CA    | $100,000       |
| NY    | $120,000       |
| FL    | $90,000        |
| ...   | ...            |

**Decennial Census** - Every 10 years the Census Bureau collects information on every person living in the U.S. Because this is a huge data collection effort, it only occurs once every decade and the questions asked are not as detailed as in the ACS.

**American Community Survey** - Every year the Census Bureau collects information on a random sample of U.S. households. This survey is known as the ACS. Because the data is collected on a much smaller sample than the Decennial Census, the ACS is able to ask more detailed questions.
